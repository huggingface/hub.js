## Use Cases

### Data Generation

Businesses can generate data for their use cases by inputting text and getting image outputs.

### Immersive Conversational Chatbots

Chatbots can be made more immersive if they provide contextual images based on the input provided by the user.

### Creative Ideas for Fashion Industry

Different patterns can be generated to obtain unique pieces of fashion. Text-to-image models make creations easier for designers to conceptualize their design before actually implementing it.

### Architecture Industry

Architects can utilise the models to construct an environment based out on the requirements of the floor plan. This can also include the furniture that has to be placed in that environment.

##Task Variants

### Image Editing

Image editing with text-to-image models involves using text prompts to describe the wanted changes in an image and then follow them.

- Synthetic image editing: using text-to-image models to make adjustments to images that were initially created using an input prompt, while preserving the overall meaning or context of the original image.

- Real image editing: similar to synthetic image editing, except we're using real photos/images. This task is usually more complex, as it involves first obtaining a latent representation of the image, in the latent domain of the model that it can then manipulate.

### Personalization

Personalization refers to techniques used to customize text-to-image models, where we introduce new subjects/concepts to the model so that we can then use the model to generate new images of those subjects with a text prompt. For example, one can use these techniques to generate images of themselves, using as little as one reference image. These include teaching the model a new concept both in training free manner or through fine-tuning.

##Â Inference

You can use diffusers pipelines to infer with `text-to-image` models.

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline, EulerDiscreteScheduler

model_id = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2"
scheduler = EulerDiscreteScheduler.from_pretrained(model_id, subfolder="scheduler")
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, scheduler=scheduler, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
```

You can use [huggingface.js](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface.js) to infer text-to-image models on Hugging Face Hub.

```javascript
import { HfInference } from "@huggingface/inference";

const inference = new HfInference(HF_TOKEN);
await inference.textToImage({
	model: "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2",
	inputs: "award winning high resolution photo of a giant tortoise/((ladybird)) hybrid, [trending on artstation]",
	parameters: {
		negative_prompt: "blurry",
	},
});
```
