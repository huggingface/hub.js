# Huggingface Widgets

Open-source version of the inference widgets from huggingface.co

> Built with Svelte and SvelteKit

**Demo page:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingfacejs/inference-widgets

You can also run the demo locally:

```console
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Publishing

Because `@huggingface/widgets` depends on `@huggingface/tasks`, you need to publish `@huggingface/tasks` first, and then `@huggingface/widgets`.
